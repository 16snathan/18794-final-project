sign_mnist_test.csv & sign_mnist_train.csv are organized into ROWS
Each row comprises all pixels of one image & its label
First column is the image's label
Columns 2-785 are the image's pixel values (from 0 to 255)

Thoughts -- try loading images directly as CSV files and reshaping them
x_train, x_test: uint8 array of grayscale image data with shape (num_samples, 28, 28).
y_train, y_test: uint8 array of digit labels (integers in range 0-9) with shape (num_samples).
(x_train, y_train) is therefore a uint8 array of RGB
